## About Me
I am Manas Ranjan Singh, currently pursuing my M.Tech in VLSI Design and Embedded Systems. With a solid foundation in Electronics and Communication Engineering and growing expertise in digital systems, I am passionate about building efficient, real-time embedded solutions and advanced VLSI architectures.

I have hands-on experience with hardware description languages like VHDL and Verilog, microcontrollers (Arduino, ARM), and simulation tools like ModelSim and Xilinx Vivado. My projects include digital logic designs, embedded systems applications, and RTL coding, which have helped me develop both my problem-solving and practical skills.

I am actively seeking opportunities in the fields of Embedded Systems, FPGA Development, RTL Design, and SoC Verification, where I can apply my technical knowledge and grow as a design engineer.

## Projects
Project Name: Vehicle Pollution Detection System
